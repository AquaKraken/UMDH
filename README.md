Below is a concise, high-level overview of the concept you’ve been exploring—an all-in-one “router-like” device or setup that seamlessly connects, controls, and shares data between a PC, laptop, and mobile devices (Android/iOS). You can use this summary as a jumping-off point for a dedicated discussion or project plan:

Project Idea: Unified Multi-Device Hub

1. Purpose



Create a “router-like” hub (using a Raspberry Pi, mini PC, or similar) that provides low-latency data sharing, input control, screen extension, and audio/video streaming across all devices (PC, laptop, Android/iOS).

2. Core Functions


3. Networking & Connectivity



Wi-Fi for mobile devices, Ethernet for PCs.

Optionally, USB tethering (Android) for ultra-low-latency connections.

Acts as a mini-router or connects to an existing router.

2. Input & Display Sharing



Keyboard/Mouse/Gamepad sharing (Synergy/Barrier-like solution).

Screen Mirroring/Extension (SpaceDesk, Deskreen, VNC).

Reverse Control: Control your phone from a PC (Scrcpy) or vice versa (remote desktop).

3. Audio & Video Synchronization



Multi-device audio streaming (Snapcast or SoundWire).

Video playback across multiple screens/devices (DLNA, multicast, or screen-sharing apps).

4. File Transfer & Synchronization



Shared clipboard (text, images).

File sync (Syncthing, Resilio Sync, Samba).

Quick drag-and-drop between devices.

5. Power & Charging



USB-C with powered hubs or OTG Y-cables to keep mobile devices charged while tethered.

Pi or mini PC with enough USB power output, or a dedicated powered USB hub.

3. Hardware Outline



Single-Board Computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4/5) OR a mini PC (Intel NUC, Lenovo Tiny).

Powered USB Hub (for peripherals and stable power).

Optional: Additional Ethernet ports (via USB adapters or a separate network switch), Wi-Fi 6 router, HDMI capture device, etc.


---

4. Software Stack



Base OS: Linux-based (Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, or OpenWRT).

Services:

Synergy/Barrier for keyboard/mouse/gamepad sharing.

SpaceDesk/Deskreen for display extension.

Snapcast/SoundWire for synced audio.

Syncthing/Resilio for file syncing.

Scrcpy for phone screen control.

VNC/Remote Desktop for cross-device control.


---

5. Next Steps & Considerations


6. Prototype on a Raspberry Pi or mini PC.


7. Configure each service (Synergy, Snapcast, etc.) for seamless integration.


8. Optimize Latency: Use USB tethering or Ethernet for demanding tasks (gaming, HD video).


9. Test with different OSes (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS) for broad compatibility.


10. Security & Encryption: Ensure data is protected on local network or when accessed remotely.

Why This Matters

Consolidates multiple partial solutions (KVM switches, streaming apps, cloud drives) into a single, user-friendly hub.

Cross-platform: Works with Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS.

Improves efficiency (one keyboard/mouse, easy file sharing, multi-device audio/video).
